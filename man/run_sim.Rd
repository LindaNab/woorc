\usage{
run_sim(nrep, type, scen_no, output_file_loc = "./")
}
\arguments{
\item{nrep}{number of replications}

\item{type}{simulation study type, either "biasvsvar" or "lowrel"}

\item{scen_no}{scenarios numbers to be used}

\item{output_file_loc}{directory where output of simulation will be saved}
}
\value{
a file named scen_no_* with the output will be saved in
output_file_loc, which constitutes of the uncorrected effect, the corrected
effect by means of mecor and the corrected effect by means of simex, the
estimated R-squared of the outcome model and the seed no.
